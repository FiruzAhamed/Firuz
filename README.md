I am a Post-Doctoral Fellow at the [**SMARTS Center**](https://www.smartscenter.org/) at the Asian Institute of Technology. 
I obtained my Ph.D. in [**Sustainable Energy Transition**](https://ait.ac.th/program/sustainable-energy-transition/) at the Asian Institute of Technology in Thailand. 
Dr. Firuz Ahamed Nahid is an electrical engineer who obtained his Ph.D. in Sustainable Energy Transition from the Asian Institute of Technology in Thailand. During his doctoral studies, he delved into the realm of artificial intelligence (AI) applications within energy management, particularly focusing on low-carbon microgrids. He has a Bachelor's degree in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from IUBAT University in Bangladesh followed by a Master's in Electric Power System Management, again from the Asian Institute of Technology, in 2019. He served as a Lecturer at IUBAT University in Bangladesh for a period of 3 years. He gained invaluable insights from engagements with both national and multinational entities within the power sector. Dr. Nahid's research expertise encompasses AI application in power systems, energy management, energy modeling, and the seamless integration of renewable energy sources. His overarching goal is to contribute significantly to the advancement of zero-carbon energy solutions that will ultimately benefit society, the environment, and future generations.
